## Technical Assumptions & Constraints

### Browser Compatibility

We target modern browsers that support the [native ES Modules](https://caniuse.com/es6-module), [native ESM dynamic import](https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import) and [`import.meta`](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_statements_import_meta).

- Chrome >=87
- Firefox >=78
- Safari >=13
- Edge >=88

For more details refer to the [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#browser-compatibility).

### JavaScript

- Use functional style React components with hooks over React component classes.
- Use [Pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/pointer_events) instead of mouse or touch specific events.

## Styleguides

### General

- Capitalize comments (“Awesome comment” instead of “awesome comment”).
- Split lines longer than 80 characters into multiple subsequent lines, if possible.
- Avoid trailing whitespaces at the ends of lines.
- Add a single newline character at the end of each file.

### Brand Styleguide

When referring to “ciphereditor” use this exact spelling (all lowercase and no space between “cipher” and “editor”).

### Git Commit Messages

1. Capitalize the subject line
2. Use the present tense (“Add feature” instead of “Added feature”)
3. Use the imperative mood (“Move cursor to…” instead of “Moves cursor to…”)
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Limit the first line to 72 characters or less

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript, JSX and TypeScript must adhere to the [Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

Additional rules:

- Never omit curly braces around blocks (e.g. after control statements like `if`, `for`, `while`, and `do`), even when they are optional.

Naming conventions:

- When dealing with [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schema objects use the naming pattern `${typeName}Schema` with a lowercase first character. Example: The Zod schema for the TypeScript type `TypedValue` is called `typedValueSchema`. Instances of `TypedValue` may be called `typedValue`.
- Use a `View` suffix when naming React components to avoid mixing them up with equally named object types (`OperationView` instead of `Operation`)

### Sass Styleguide

We use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) with the [SCSS syntax](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss) for CSS style generation and follow the [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) (introducing blocks, elements and modifiers) with the [Two Dashes style](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/#two-dashes-style) to organize and name our CSS classes.

- Introduce new BEM blocks or elements instead of using HTML tags as selectors to keep the CSS specificity flat. Default styles for HTML tags go to `generics.scss`.

## Work amenities

Wearing nice sneakers while coding is not a requirement but it is very much appreciated.
